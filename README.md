# EuroCSDMS - eWaterCycle hands-on demonstration

This repository holds a jupyter book with a demonstration of the eWaterCycle platform.
The material has been developed for use in the
[EuroCSDMS workshop](https://eurocsdmswork.shop/) _"What does the next generation of environmental models look like?" organized by Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) in October 2024 at Rydall Hall, Lake District, UK_

You can view the book [**here**](https://www.ewatercycle.org/eurocsdms_workshop).

### Notebooks 
The material in this book is intended to showcase how the eWaterCycle platform is build upon the [Basic Model Interface (BMI)](https://bmi.readthedocs.io/) to provide hydrologist with an easy to use way to work with their, and each others, models and data. 
During the workshop the notebooks can be run on a Jupter Lab server. However, this server is not publicly accessible and is shut down after the workshop.

If you are reading this page and are interested in running these notebooks, you can either:

- setup your own server that runs eWaterCycle (or install it on a big enough laptop / desktop computer). See the information on this topic in the [ewatercycle documentation](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system_setup.html) on how to setup eWaterCycle
- send us an email at [questions@ewatercycle.org](mailto:questions@ewatercycle.org) where you explain your interest in eWaterCycle and we can (hopefully) help you further.
- in the near future we hope to provide access to eWaterCycle through other platforms such as the UKCEH's [Datalabs](https://datalab.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/) as well as the Destination Earth platform of the European Union. Stay tuned!
